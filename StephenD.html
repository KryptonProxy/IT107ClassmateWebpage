    		<p>My Name is Stephen Dingess. I was born on July  17, 2000 at Cabell Huntington Hospital. When I was 4 I had heart surgery becuase I had a tissue blocking the main artery of my heart. When the doctor was operating they nicked my mitrovalve. A year later I was put in foster care I went from home to home for 7 months. In April 30th 2006 my mom was suddenly killed in car accident. My aunt was finally able to gain custody of me. Flash forward to today I am a devoted christian. I am constantly in church. I am the first one in my family to graduate from Wayne High School. I have recently been baptied by the holy ghost. I have noe got the gift of prophetic vision and speaking in tounges.</p>
